# 5G
One of the challenge groups provided by the CISS CTF was related to 5G communication.

## The wraith in the network
Our intelligence operatives have a captured flow (PCAP)
of mystical communications between high-value targets using 
the Palantír Network. As they were transfering the captured
flow, an enemy sorcerer modified the captured flow and 
managed to hide a subscriber in the AAA flow.

Your Mission: Analyze the captured flow, dissect 
the core mystical **AAA protocols**, then find this 
**hidden subscriber** that never existed within our 
sacred communication channels and decipher him.

Submit: CISS25{DECIPHERED_FLAG}

This challenge provided us with a PCAP file and the task to find a hidden subscriber in the AAA protocolls.

AAA protocols, which stand for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting, are a set of standards used to manage and control access to network resources.
Common protocolls include RADIUS, TACACS+ and Diameter.

For analyis we used [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
The filter for RADIUS and TACACS+ brought no results so we searched only for `diameter`. This reduced the amount of frames from 5027 to 66. Next we filtered out all Watchdog commands with `diameter.cmd.code != 280`. Left are 12 frames with Push-Profile Answer and Request as well as Abort-Session.
Now we are interessted in new subscribers. We can get frames with this information through filtering of the AVP code 443 `diameter.avp.code == 443` (src. [RFC](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4006.txt)).

With this the filter looks like `diameter && diameter.cmd.code != 280 && diameter.avp.code == 443` and we have only two packages left.

There are now two subscription IDs.
> sip:5Y5_T3VW0R@ims.mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org
>
> sip:+650000007@ims.mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org

With `frame contains "650000007"` we can check that the second ID is first seen in frame 1362.  
The 5Y5_T3VW0R (`frame contains "5Y5_T3VW0R"`) is first seen in the diameter frame 2731.

With this we have our hidden subscriber.   
All that is left is to decipher him.   
With the ceasar cipher we can shift by -4 or +22 (a to w) to get 5U5_P3RS0N.
