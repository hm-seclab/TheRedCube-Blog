# CISS 2025 Finals ICS CTF

We made it into the finals of the [CISS 2025 ICS CTF](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/ciss-2025/), organized by [iTrust](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/), the [SUTD](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/), and the Singapore [DIS](https://www.dis.gov.sg/). The finals took place at the end of September 2025. Although we participated remotely, we had access to the actual real systems in the iTrust lab in Singapore. This was a great experience for us, and we want to thank the organizers again for the opportunity.

We were thrilled to finish in **1st** place out of **10 teams** and to win prize money of over **5,000 SGD**.

The CTF finals took place in three stages:
- First, we received information about the systems and the network topology, including extensive listings of the systems and a large set of pcap files that were recorded in the iTrust lab.
- Based on this information, we took part in the discovery phase, where we accessed the systems to explore them and validate our setups during a 3-hour period.
- Finally, the attack phase required us to perform attacks on the systems during a 4-hour period.

A detailed list of our findings and results is available in our [Engagement Report](/TheRedCube-Blog/assets/CISS2025-Report.pdf), which we submitted to the organizers after the CTF.
