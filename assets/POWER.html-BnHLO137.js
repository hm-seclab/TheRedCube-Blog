Understanding these protective thresholds is crucial for both defensive planning and potential vulnerability assessment.</em></p><p><em>The Challenge: During siege conditions or infrastructure attacks, certain sectors of Minas Tirith may experience under-voltage situations that threaten critical systems. The PLC in Rath Celen Ward monitors energy levels and automatically sacrifices less critical loads to preserve power for essential defenses. However, the exact triggering thresholds of these protective enchantments remain a closely guarded secret.</em></p><p><em>Threshold Discovery: Through careful analysis of the mystical communication protocols and PLC behavior, determine the precise voltage threshold at which the load shedding enchantments activate.

A nmap scan of the system revealed that the ports 102, 502, 8080 and 20000 are open which hints at the protocols IEC 61850 MMS, Modbus, HTTP and DNP3. Using our setup with IED Explorer we were able to connect to the PLC and query all values which were quite comprehensive but also a bit overwhelming. We figured after some trials that this values don&#39;t expose the control logic that would be implemented as some form of code in the PLC. So instead we looked at the 8080 interface, which revealed a web interface of an OpenPLC which was configured with default credentials <code>openplc</code> and <code>openplc</code>. This allowed us to access the PLC web UI. The web UI allows the execution of custom code in the PLC, which can be used to open a reverse shell to the PLC as described in the following Github project: <a href="https://github.com/machevalia/OpenPLC-CVE-2021-31630-RCE/blob/main/OpenPLC_CVE_2021_31630.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenPLC Reverse Shell</a></p><p>With this we were able to access the PLC which was a Ubuntu Docker Container.

But to make sure (and because we enjoyed this OpenPLC setup) we looked at the .icd configuration files, which are the SCL (Substation Configuration Language) files that describe the IEDs configuration according to the IEC 61850 standard and as often discussed in the IEC 62559 the use case methodology and the SGAM (Smart Grid Architecture Model). There we find a comprehensive description of the configuration. <code>/OpenPLC61850/webserver/scl_client_files_DS3PLC/DS3CB4.icd</code> contains the following configuration for its IP address which confirms our assumption <strong>172.24.20.15</strong>.</p><div class="language-xml line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="xml" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code class="language-xml"><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF;">  &lt;</span><span style="--shiki-light:#E45649;--shiki-dark:#E06C75;">Communication</span><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF;">&gt;</span></span>
